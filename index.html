        <p style="padding-right: 25px;padding-left: 25px;">There are two main modern fields where trigonometry has direct practical applications those being software, and architecture. There are many more, but these are the main ones. In almost every visual effect on your screen that isn't straight up and down or static requires trig to happen since computers don't natural understand curves or angles only straight up and down and left and right. In architecture every complex structure that has or need to use "Measuring fields, lots and areas;
Making walls parallel and perpendicular;
Installing ceramic tiles;
Roof inclination;
The height of the building, the width length etc. and the many other such things where it becomes necessary to use trigonometry." (<a href="http://www.mathnasium.com/real-life-applications-of-trigonometry">http://www.mathnasium.com/real-life-applications-of-trigonometry)</a></p>

        <p>Personally, what we really learned with this project was how the identities connect. You can see all of them in isolation, but when trying to explain and guide through them you begin to see connections between them, and how they build off of each other. We at first struggled with explaining the identities in a simple way, without losing too much information, but as we went on with the project that became easier.</p>
